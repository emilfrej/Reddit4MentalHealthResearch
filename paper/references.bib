  abstract = {Topic modeling is used for discovering latent semantic structure, usually referred to as topics, in a large collection of documents. The most widely used methods are Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis. Despite their popularity they have several weaknesses. In order to achieve optimal results they often require the number of topics to be known, custom stop-word lists, stemming, and lemmatization. Additionally these methods rely on bag-of-words representation of documents which ignore the ordering and semantics of words. Distributed representations of documents and words have gained popularity due to their ability to capture semantics of words and documents. We present \$\textbackslash texttt\{top2vec\}\$, which leverages joint document and word semantic embedding to find \$\textbackslash textit\{topic vectors\}\$. This model does not require stop-word lists, stemming or lemmatization, and it automatically finds the number of topics. The resulting topic vectors are jointly embedded with the document and word vectors with distance between them representing semantic similarity. Our experiments demonstrate that \$\textbackslash texttt\{top2vec\}\$ finds topics which are significantly more informative and representative of the corpus trained on than probabilistic generative models.},

  abstract = {To understand natural language use during public online discussions around topics related to suicidality, we used large language model-based sentence embedding to extract the latent linguistic dimensions of user postings derived from several mental health related subreddit channels, with a focus on suicidality. We then apply dimensionality reduction to these sentence embeddings, allowing them to be summarized and visualized in a lower dimensional Euclidean space for further downstream analyses. We analyzed 2.9 million posts extracted from 30 subreddit channels, including suicide watch, between October 1st, 2022, and December 31st, 2022, and the same period in 2010. Our results showed that, in line with existing theories of suicide, posters in the suicidality community ("Suicide Watch") predominantly wrote about feelings of disconnection, burdensomeness, hopeless, desperation, resignation, and trauma. Further, we identified distinct latent linguistic dimensions (well-being, seeking support, and severity of distress) among all mental health subreddits, and the resulting subreddit clusters were in line with a statistically-driven diagnostic classification system - namely the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) - by mapping onto purposed superspectra. Overall, our findings provide data-driven support for several language-based theories of suicide as well as dimensional classification systems for mental health disorders. Ultimately, this novel combination of natural language processing techniques can assist researchers in gaining deeper insights about emotions and experiences shared online, and may aid in the validation and refutation of different mental health theories.},

We identify several areas of research opportunities: 1. in technology, combining electronic diary reports with collateral measures such as ambulatory heart rate; 2. in measurement, switching from measures based on between-person differences to those based on within-person changes; and 3. in research questions, using diaries to (a) explain why people differ in variability rather than mean level, (b) study change processes during major events and transitions, and (c) study interpersonal processes using dyadic and group diary methods.},

However, there are many important challenges in moving from theory to empirical research and clinical practice and vice versa. Therefore, in this article, we bring together different points of view on psychological networks by methodologists and clinicians to give a critical overview on these challenges, and to present an agenda for addressing these challenges. In contrast to previous reviews, we especially focus on methodological issues related to temporal networks. This includes topics such as selecting and assessing the quality of the nodes in the network, distinguishing between- and within-person effects in networks, relating items that are measured at different time scales, and dealing with changes in network structures. These issues are not only important for researchers using network models on empirical data, but also for clinicians, who are increasingly likely to encounter (person-specific) networks in the consulting room.},

  abstract = {Mental health professionals typically encounter patients at 1 point in patients’ lives. This cross-sectional window understandably fosters focus on the current presenting diagnosis. Research programs, treatment protocols, specialist clinics, and specialist journals are oriented to presenting diagnoses, on the assumption that diagnosis informs about causes and prognosis. This study tests an alternative hypothesis: people with mental disorders experience many different kinds of disorders across diagnostic families, when followed for 4 decades.To describe mental disorder life histories across the first half of the life course.This cohort study involved participants born in New Zealand from 1972 to 1973 who were enrolled in the population-representative Dunedin Study. Participants were observed from birth to age 45 years (until April 2019). Data were analyzed from May 2019 to January 2020.Diagnosed impairing disorders were assessed 9 times from ages 11 to 45 years. Brain function was assessed through neurocognitive examinations conducted at age 3 years, neuropsychological testing during childhood and adulthood, and midlife neuroimaging-based brain age.Of 1037 original participants (535 male [51.6\%]), 1013 had mental health data available. The proportions of participants meeting the criteria for a mental disorder were as follows: 35\% (346 of 975) at ages 11 to 15 years, 50\% (473 of 941) at age 18 years, 51\% (489 of 961) at age 21 years, 48\% (472 of 977) at age 26 years, 46\% (444 of 969) at age 32 years, 45\% (429 of 955) at age 38 years, and 44\% (407 of 927) at age 45 years. The onset of the disorder occurred by adolescence for 59\% of participants (600 of 1013), eventually affecting 86\% of the cohort (869 of 1013) by midlife. By age 45 years, 85\% of participants (737 of 869) with a disorder had accumulated comorbid diagnoses. Participants with adolescent-onset disorders subsequently presented with disorders at more past-year assessments (r\,=\,0.71; 95\% CI, 0.68 to 0.74; P\,\&lt;\,.001) and met the criteria for more diverse disorders (r\,=\,0.64; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 0.67; P\,\&lt;\,.001). Confirmatory factor analysis summarizing mental disorder life histories across 4 decades identified a general factor of psychopathology, the p-factor. Longitudinal analyses showed that high p-factor scores (indicating extensive mental disorder life histories) were antedated by poor neurocognitive functioning at age 3 years (r\,=\,−0.18; 95\% CI, −0.24 to −0.12; P\,\&lt;\,.001), were accompanied by childhood-to-adulthood cognitive decline (r\,=\,−0.11; 95\% CI, −0.17 to −0.04; P\,\&lt;\,.001), and were associated with older brain age at midlife (r\,=\,0.14; 95\% CI, 0.07 to 0.20; P\,\&lt;\,.001).These findings suggest that mental disorder life histories shift among different successive disorders. Data from the present study, alongside nationwide data from Danish health registers, inform a life-course perspective on mental disorders. This perspective cautions against overreliance on diagnosis-specific research and clinical protocols.},

  abstract = {The independent component analysis (ICA) of a random vector consists of searching for a linear transformation that minimizes the statistical dependence between its components. In order to define suitable search criteria, the expansion of mutual information is utilized as a function of cumulants of increasing orders. An efficient algorithm is proposed, which allows the computation of the ICA of a data matrix within a polynomial time. The concept of ICA may actually be seen as an extension of the principal component analysis (PCA), which can only impose independence up to the second order and, consequently, defines directions that are orthogonal. Potential applications of ICA include data analysis and compression, Bayesian detection, localization of sources, and blind identification and deconvolution. Zusammenfassung Die Analyse unabhängiger Komponenten (ICA) eines Vektors beruht auf der Suche nach einer linearen Transformation, die die statistische Abhängigkeit zwischen den Komponenten minimiert. Zur Definition geeigneter Such-Kriterien wird die Entwicklung gemeinsamer Information als Funktion von Kumulanten steigender Ordnung genutzt. Es wird ein effizienter Algorithmus vorgeschlagen, der die Berechnung der ICA für Datenmatrizen innerhalb einer polynomischen Zeit erlaubt. Das Konzept der ICA kann eigentlich als Erweiterung der ‘Principal Component Analysis‘ (PCA) betrachtet werden, die nur die Unabhängigkeit bis zur zweiten Ordnung erzwingen kann und deshalb Richtungen definiert, die orthogonal sind. Potentielle Anwendungen der ICA beinhalten Daten-Analyse und Kompression, Bayes-Detektion, Quellenlokalisierung und blinde Identifikation und Entfaltung. Résumé L'Analyse en Composantes Indépendentes (ICA) d'un vecteur aléatoire consiste en la recherche d'une transformation linéaire qui minimise la dépendance statistique entre ses composantes. Afin de définir des critères d'optimisation appropriés, on utilise un développment en série de l'information mutuelle en fonction de cumulants d'ordre croissant. On propose ensuite un algorithme pratique permettant le calcul de l'ICA d'une matrice de données en un temps polynomial. Le concept d'ICA peut être vu en réalité comme une extention de l'Analyse en Composantes Principales (PCA) qui, elle, ne peut imposer l'indépendence qu'au second ordre et définit par conséquent des directions orthogonales. Les applications potentielles de l'ICA incluent l'analyse et la compression de données, la détection bayesienne, la localisation de sources, et l'identification et la déconvolution aveugles.},

  abstract = {The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) addressed in its 2008 Strategic Plan an emerging concern that the current diagnostic system was hampering translational research, as accumulating data suggested that disorder categories constituted heterogeneous syndromes rather than specific diseases. However, established practices in peer review placed high priority on extant disorders in evaluating grant applications for mental illness. To provide guidelines for alternative study designs, NIMH included a goal to develop new ways of studying psychopathology based on dimensions of measurable behavior and related neurobiological measures. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project is the result, intended to build a literature that informs new conceptions of mental illness and future revisions to diagnostic manuals. The framework calls for the study of empirically-derived fundamental dimensions as characterized by related behavioral/psychological and neurobiological data (e.g., reward valuation, working memory). RDoC also emphasizes full-range dimensional approaches (from typical to increasingly abnormal), neurodevelopment and environmental effects, and research designs that integrate data across behavioral, biological, and self-report measures. This commentary provides an overview of the project’s first decade and its potential future directions. RDoC remains grounded in experimental psychopathology perspectives, and its progress is strongly linked to psychological measurement and integrative approaches to brain-behavior relationships.},

In particular, it models each word with a categorical distribution whose natural parameter is the inner product between a word embedding and an embedding of its assigned topic. To fit the ETM, we develop an efficient amortized variational inference algorithm. The ETM discovers interpretable topics even with large vocabularies that include rare words and stop words. It outperforms existing document models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), in terms of both topic quality and predictive performance.},

  abstract = {The usage of psychological networks that conceptualize behavior as a complex interplay of psychological and other components has gained increasing popularity in various research fields. While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this field and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

  abstract = {Researchers in the field of network psychometrics often focus on the estimation of Gaussian graphical models (GGMs)—an undirected network model of partial correlations—between observed variables of cross-sectional data or single-subject time-series data. This assumes that all variables are measured without measurement error, which may be implausible. In addition, cross-sectional data cannot distinguish between within-subject and between-subject effects. This paper provides a general framework that extends GGM modeling with latent variables, including relationships over time. These relationships can be estimated from time-series data or panel data featuring at least three waves of measurement. The model takes the form of a graphical vector-autoregression model between latent variables and is termed the ts-lvgvar when estimated from time-series data and the panel-lvgvar when estimated from panel data. These methods have been implemented in the software package psychonetrics, which is exemplified in two empirical examples, one using time-series data and one using panel data, and evaluated in two large-scale simulation studies. The paper concludes with a discussion on ergodicity and generalizability. Although within-subject effects may in principle be separated from between-subject effects, the interpretation of these results rests on the intensity and the time interval of measurement and on the plausibility of the assumption of stationarity.},

  abstract = {Studying mental health at scale requires perspectives that extend beyond traditional clinical and research settings. Increasingly, people turn to social media platforms like Reddit to make sense of their distress, seek support, and explore alternative ways of understanding mental health outside institutional frameworks. This study maps the landscape of mental health discourse on Reddit by constructing a data-driven network of associations between mental disorders and comparing it with the network based on diagnostic criteria. We manually curated 114 Reddit communities focused on specific mental health conditions from the 20,000 most active subreddits in 2022. Each community was labeled into 49 disorders and categorized under nine ICD-10 diagnostic categories belonging to the group of mental and behavioral disorders (“F” codes). We constructed a disorder association network by identifying statistically significant user overlaps across subreddit pairs using a bipartite configuration model, with Bonferroni-corrected significance (p \&lt; 0.001). Edges represent either positive or negative associations based on observed versus expected user overlap. We analyzed the connectedness of the network within and across diagnostic categories and compared the emergent Reddit-based hierarchy of disorder associations with the formal structure encoded in ICD-10 using hierarchical clustering and tree similarity metrics. The inferred Reddit network of psychopathology revealed a densely interconnected structure, with all but six disorders forming a single giant component spanning diagnostic categories. The most prominent disorders by user volume included ADHD, depression, habit and impulse disorders, autism, and generalized anxiety. However, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depersonalization/derealization (DPDR), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibited the highest connectivity by number of associations, while schizotypal disorder, avoidant personality disorder, and agoraphobia ranked highest in weighted degree. Bipolar disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) displayed high inter-category associations but weak in-category ties, indicating complex diagnostic boundaries. The network of negative associations further revealed divergences from past expectations; for instance, addiction-related communities (e.g., alcohol and opioids) were negatively associated with much of the broader mental health discourse. Finally, hierarchical comparisons showed moderate overlap between Reddit-derived associations and ICD-10 diagnostic structures, both in pairwise edge similarity (Jaccard = 0.07) and overall clustering (ARI = 0.307, NMI = 0.706). Overall, Reddit-based mental health communities reveal a complementary structure of disorder associations shaped by lived experience, often diverging from formal diagnostic criteria and highlighting overlooked or cross-cutting patterns of comorbidity.},

It considers what would happen if we treated diagnostic categories not as causes of signs and symptoms, but as diagnostic consequences of psychopathology and pathophysiology. This reformulation (of the standard nosological model) opens the door to a more natural description of how patients present—and of their likely responses to therapeutic interventions. In brief, we describe a model that generates symptoms, signs, and diagnostic outcomes from latent psychopathological states. In turn, psychopathology is caused by pathophysiological processes that are perturbed by (etiological) causes such as predisposing factors, life events, and therapeutic interventions. The key advantages of this nosological formulation include (i) the formal integration of diagnostic (e.g., DSM) categories and latent psychopathological constructs (e.g., the dimensions of the Research Domain Criteria); (ii) the provision of a hypothesis or model space that accommodates formal, evidence-based hypothesis testing (using Bayesian model comparison); and (iii) the ability to predict therapeutic responses (using a posterior predictive density), as in precision medicine. These and other advantages are largely promissory at present: The purpose of this article is to show what might be possible, through the use of idealized simulations.},

  abstract = {Introduction The vast number of psychopathological syndromes that can be observed in clinical practice can be described in terms of a limited number of elementary syndromes that are differentially expressed. Previous attempts to identify elementary syndromes have shown limitations that have slowed progress in the taxonomy of psychiatric disorders. Aim To examine the ability of network community detection (NCD) to identify elementary syndromes of psychopathology and move beyond the limitations of current classification methods in psychiatry. Methods 192 patients with unselected mental disorders were tested on the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the bootstrapped correlation matrix of symptom scores to extract the principal component structure (PCS). An undirected and weighted network graph was constructed from the same matrix. Network community structure (NCS) was optimized using a previously published technique. Results In the optimal network structure, network clusters showed a 89\% match with principal components of psychopathology. Some 6 network clusters were found, including "DEPRESSION", "MANIA", “ANXIETY”, "PSYCHOSIS", "RETARDATION", and "BEHAVIORAL DISORGANIZATION". Network metrics were used to quantify the continuities between the elementary syndromes. Conclusion We present the first comprehensive network graph of psychopathology that is free from the biases of previous classifications: a ‘Psychopathology Web’. Clusters within this network represent elementary syndromes that are connected via a limited number of bridge symptoms. Many problems of previous classifications can be overcome by using a network approach to psychopathology.},

  abstract = {Topic models can be useful tools to discover latent topics in collections of documents. Recent studies have shown the feasibility of approach topic modeling as a clustering task. We present BERTopic, a topic model that extends this process by extracting coherent topic representation through the development of a class-based variation of TF-IDF. More specifically, BERTopic generates document embedding with pre-trained transformer-based language models, clusters these embeddings, and finally, generates topic representations with the class-based TF-IDF procedure. BERTopic generates coherent topics and remains competitive across a variety of benchmarks involving classical models and those that follow the more recent clustering approach of topic modeling.},

  abstract = {I present an ontology of criteria for evaluating theory to answer the titular question from the perspective of a scientist practitioner. Set inside a formal account of our adjudication over theories, a metatheoretical calculus, this ontology comprises the following: (a) metaphysical commitment, the need to highlight what parts of theory are not under investigation, but are assumed, asserted, or essential; (b) discursive survival, the ability to be understood by interested non-bad actors, to withstand scrutiny within the intended (sub)field(s), and to negotiate the dialectical landscape thereof; (c) empirical interface, the potential to explicate the relationship between theory and observation, i.e., how observations relate to, and affect, theory and vice versa; (d) minimising harm, the reckoning with how theory is forged in a fire of historical, if not ongoing, abuses—from past crimes against humanity, to current exploitation, turbocharged or hyped by machine learning, to historical and present internal academic marginalisation. This work hopes to serve as a possible beginning for scientists who want to examine the properties and characteristics of theories, to propose additional virtues and vices, and to engage in further dialogue. Finally, I appeal to practitioners to iterate frequently over such criteria, by building and sharing the metatheoretical calculi used to adjudicate over theories.},

However, because of the diversity of datasets and metrics, there have not been many efforts to systematically compare their performance on the same benchmarks and under the same conditions. In this paper, we present a selection of 9 topic modelling techniques from the state of the art reflecting a diversity of approaches to the task, an overview of the different metrics used to compare their performance, and the challenges of conducting such a comparison. We empirically evaluate the performance of these models on different settings reflecting a variety of real-life conditions in terms of dataset size, number of topics, and distribution of topics, following identical preprocessing and evaluation processes. Using both metrics that rely on the intrinsic characteristics of the dataset (different coherence metrics), as well as external knowledge (word embeddings and ground-truth topic labels), our experiments reveal several shortcomings regarding the common practices in topic models evaluation.},

We have conducted a comprehensive review of published taxometric research that included 177 articles, 311 distinct findings and a combined sample of 533 377 participants. Multilevel logistic regression analyses have examined the methodological and substantive variables associated with taxonic (categorical) findings. Although 38.9\% of findings were taxonic, these findings were much less frequent in more recent and methodologically stronger studies, and in those reporting comparative fit indices based on simulated comparison data. When these and other possible confounds were statistically controlled, the true prevalence of taxonic findings was estimated at 14\%. The domains of normal personality, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, externalizing disorders, and personality disorders (PDs) other than schizotypal yielded little persuasive evidence of taxa. Promising but still not definitive evidence of psychological taxa was confined to the domains of schizotypy, substance use disorders and autism. This review indicates that most latent variables of interest to psychiatrists and personality and clinical psychologists are dimensional, and that many influential taxonic findings of early taxometric research are likely to be spurious.},

We report the first meta-analysis of taxometric research, examining 317 findings drawn from 183 articles that employed an index of the comparative fit of observed data to dimensional and taxonic data simulations. Findings supporting dimensional models outnumbered those supporting taxonic models five to one. There were systematic differences among 17 construct domains in support for the two models, but psychopathology was no more likely to generate taxonic findings than normal variation (i.e. individual differences in personality, response styles, gender, and sexuality). No content domain showed aggregate support for the taxonic model. Six variables – alcohol use disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, problem gambling, autism, suicide risk, and pedophilia – emerged as the most plausible taxon candidates based on a preponderance of independently replicated findings. We also compared the 317 meta-analyzed findings to 185 additional taxometric findings from 96 articles that did not employ the comparative fit index. Studies that used the index were 4.88 times more likely to generate dimensional findings than those that did not after controlling for construct domain, implying that many taxonic findings obtained before the popularization of simulation-based techniques are spurious. The meta-analytic findings support the conclusion that the great majority of psychological differences between people are latently continuous, and that psychopathology is no exception.},

One lesson is that the reason a "good" theory should be testable, be coherent, be economical, be generalizable, and explain known findings is that all of these characteristics serve the primary function of a theory--to be generative of new ideas and new discoveries. Other lessons concern how to develop a theory (whether one's own or an adopted one). One lesson is to know what the theory is and what it is not--don't make it into something else either by "improving" it or by unfairly dismissing it. Know the theory's domain of applicability--do test its limits but don't overextend it. Know when the theory makes a prediction and when it does not--know when it is simply silent. This article concludes by offering the metaphor that the lessons for developing a theory to make it useful have a lot in common with good parenting. For example: Neither spoil nor abuse the theory; neither neglect nor abandon it; support and nurture the theory; don't overprotect it but do defend it; be patient with the theory--don't push it too hard or too fast; and finally, don't forget to love and enjoy it.},

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), third edition answered this need by introducing operationalized diagnostic criteria that were field-tested for interrater reliability. Unfortunately, the focus on reliability came at a time when the scientific understanding of mental disorders was embryonic and could not yield valid disease definitions. Based on accreting problems with the current DSM-fourth edition (DSM-IV) classification, it is apparent that validity will not be achieved simply by refining criteria for existing disorders or by the addition of new disorders. Yet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria dominate thinking about mental disorders in clinical practice, research, treatment development, and law. As a result, the modern DSM system, intended to create a shared language, also creates epistemic blinders that impede progress toward valid diagnoses. Insights that are beginning to emerge from psychology, neuroscience, and genetics suggest possible strategies for moving forward.},

  abstract = {Background: Social media platforms have witnessed a substantial increase in mental health–related discussions, with particular attention focused on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. This heightened interest coincides with growing neurodiversity advocacy. The impact of these changes in the conceptualization of ADHD and autism, and the relationship between the 2 conditions, remains underexplored. Objective: We aim to characterize and understand how the relationship between ADHD and autism has evolved in public discourse over the past decade and explore reasons for their growing alignment. Methods: Using Reddit data from 2012 to 2022, we investigated the frequency of ADHD mentions in r/autism and autism mentions in r/ADHD, compared to commonly mentioned conditions. We analyzed user overlap between the 2 subreddits to track cross-subreddit discussions. Following this, we assessed changes in semantic similarity between ADHD and autism using Word2Vec embedding models, alongside commonly mentioned conditions. Finally, thematic changes in subreddit discussions were explored using BERT-based topic modeling across 2 time periods. Results: Our analysis revealed that ADHD and autism have become progressively more associated across these multiple dimensions. In r/ADHD, there was a steep rise in the proportion of posts mentioning “autism” in 2021, overtaking “bipolar” and “OCD” (obsessive-compulsive disorder) to become the most frequently mentioned condition. Similarly, ADHD mentions increased steadily in r/autism, while the frequency of posts mentioning “OCD,” “PTSD” (posttraumatic stress disorder), and “bipolar” remained stable and low. User overlap between these subreddits grew substantially beginning in 2020. Semantic analysis showed ADHD and autism becoming more closely related from 2019 onward, compared to other conditions. Last, topic modeling indicated growing thematic convergence in ADHD- and autism-related discussions, which reflected an increasing shared emphasis on the experiences of adults with ADHD and autism, challenges in accessing diagnostic assessments, and interpersonal difficulties. Conclusions: Our study clarifies how discourse around these 2 conditions has converged during a period when they have both attracted rising public attention. These findings contribute to wider discussions about the impacts of rising public interest in mental health concepts. They illustrate that public understandings of relationships between conditions are dynamic and changing in ways that diverge from diagnostic frameworks. Future research should continue investigating changing mental health conceptualizations on social media, as these dynamics are becoming increasingly important for the future of psychiatric practice.},

S3 conceptualizes topics as independent axes of semantic space and uncovers these by decomposing contextualized document embeddings using Independent Component Analysis. Our approach provides diverse and highly coherent topics, requires no preprocessing, and is demonstrated to be the fastest contextual topic model, being, on average, 4.5x faster than the runner-up BERTopic1.

Users can utilize the power of large language models (LLMs) to give human-readable names to topics.

  abstract = {This essay explores four answers to the question 'What kinds of things are psychiatric disorders?' Essentialist kinds are classes whose members share an essence from which their defining features arise. Although elegant and appropriate for some physical (e.g. atomic elements) and medical (e.g. Mendelian disorders) phenomena, this model is inappropriate for psychiatric disorders, which are multi-factorial and 'fuzzy'. Socially constructed kinds are classes whose members are defined by the cultural context in which they arise. This model excludes the importance of shared physiological mechanisms by which the same disorder could be identified across different cultures. Advocates of practical kinds put off metaphysical questions about 'reality' and focus on defining classes that are useful. Practical kinds models for psychiatric disorders, implicit in the DSM nosologies, do not require that diagnoses be grounded in shared causal processes. If psychiatry seeks to tie disorders to etiology and underlying mechanisms, a model first proposed for biological species, mechanistic property cluster (MPC) kinds, can provide a useful framework. MPC kinds are defined not in terms of essences but in terms of complex, mutually reinforcing networks of causal mechanisms. We argue that psychiatric disorders are objectively grounded features of the causal structure of the mind/brain. MPC kinds are fuzzy sets defined by mechanisms at multiple levels that act and interact to produce the key features of the kind. Like species, psychiatric disorders are populations with central paradigmatic and more marginal members. The MPC view is the best current answer to 'What kinds of things are psychiatric disorders?'},

METHODS: Data from patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for the aforementioned disorders according to two psychiatrists and who were followed for at least 2 years were included in this study. We reviewed the medical records and compared the diagnosis given at the index admission with assessments made every 6 months for 2 years after discharge to determine diagnostic stability. RESULTS: A total of 138 patients with MDD, 56 patients with BID, and 107 patients with SPR who were followed for 2 years were included in the final analyses. The data showed that 84.8\% of the sample retained their initial diagnosis of MDD during the first year; this figure decreased to 79.0\% during the second year. During the first year, 93.5\% retained their initial diagnosis of BID, and this figure decreased to 89.3\% during the second year; 86.8\% and 86.9\% retained their diagnosis of SPR during the first and second years, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study showed the instability of three major DSM-IV diagnoses among Korean patients. Additionally, the results demonstrated that accurate diagnosis using the current diagnostic system requires longitudinal observation.},

  abstract = {Does the People's Republic of China (PRC) interfere with European elections through ethnic Chinese diaspora media? This question forms the basis of an ongoing research project exploring how PRC narratives about European elections are represented in Chinese diaspora media, and thus the objectives of PRC news media manipulation. In order to study diaspora media efficiently and at scale, it is necessary to use techniques derived from quantitative text analysis, such as topic modelling. In this paper, we present a pipeline for studying information dynamics in Chinese media. Firstly, we present KeyNMF, a new approach to static and dynamic topic modelling using transformer-based contextual embedding models. We provide benchmark evaluations to demonstrate that our approach is competitive on a number of Chinese datasets and metrics. Secondly, we integrate KeyNMF with existing methods for describing information dynamics in complex systems. We apply this pipeline to data from five news sites, focusing on the period of time leading up to the 2024 European parliamentary elections. Our methods and results demonstrate the effectiveness of KeyNMF for studying information dynamics in Chinese media and lay groundwork for further work addressing the broader research questions.},

  abstract = {Recent data mining research has focused on the analysis of social media text, content and networks to identify suicide ideation online. However, there has been limited research on the temporal dynamics of users and suicide ideation. In this work, we use time-to-event modeling to identify which subreddits have a higher association with users transitioning to posting on r/suicidewatch. For this purpose we use a Cox proportional hazards model that takes as input text and subreddit network features and outputs a probability distribution for the time until a Reddit user posts on r/suicidewatch. In our analysis we find a number of statistically significant features that predict earlier transitions to r/suicidewatch. While some patterns match existing intuition, for example r/depression is positively associated with posting sooner on r/suicidewatch, others were more surprising (for example, the average time between a high risk post on r/Wishlist and a post on r/suicidewatch is 10.2 days). We then discuss these results as well as directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Given the dearth of research on adulthood in autism prior to the last decade, we need methods to accelerate progress. One area of interest is mental health, but studies focusing on isolated methods or limited sets of constructs are unlikely to rapidly identify the many contributors to autistic adult mental health outcomes. We argue that adopting a multimethod, dimensional approach will more rapidly speed progress. One framework designed to encourage this approach is the National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDoC) initiative. In this article, we describe the utility of the RDoC and considerations for the design of an RDoC-inspired autism study. We demonstrate this via an example focused on suicide because suicide is one serious and well-documented sequelae of poor mental health. This article begins with a brief overview of the significance of suicide to autism. Then, the article outlines key aspects of the RDoC, including consideration of the following: dimensional processes, development, different units of analysis (methods), content domains, and environmental influences. We describe the University of Pittsburgh Autism Center of Excellence as project context; it adds an example of how RDoC can work and concepts to consider when designing an RDoC-inspired autism study. Specific methods and constructs are highlighted that may lead to improved understanding of suicide and mental health in autistic adults, and ultimately to more tailored interventions and supports.},

Edited and written by leading international experts, many of whom are actively involved with the development of the DSM-V and ICD-11, the book integrates biological and psychosocial perspectives. Contributors highlight the implications of current theoretical and empirical advances for understanding real-world clinical problems and designing more effective treatments. The volume begins with a concise historical survey of psychopathology that leads up to present-day understandings and key influences in the field. Chapters critically examine existing diagnostic systems, providing balanced analyses of such issues as the role of social context and culture in mental illness and the pros and cons of categorical versus dimensional approaches to diagnosis. Questions of comorbidity are addressed; for example, why do so many individuals experience both depression and anxiety? Cutting-edge diagnostic instruments are reviewed, and findings from exemplary research programs are presented. Showcasing advances that have occurred since the publication of DSM-IV, the book explores ways to bridge the gap between neurobiological and psychological research methods. Innovative proposals are outlined for reconceptualizing a range of clinical problems, including personality disorders, psychoses, autism spectrum disorders, and relationship difficulties. This book belongs on the desks of practitioners, researchers, and graduate students in clinical psychology, psychiatry, and clinical social work. It will serve as a text in graduate-level courses and psychiatric residency programs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Background: In 2013, a few years after the launch of the National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, Cuthbert and Insel published a paper titled “Toward the future of psychiatric diagnosis: the seven pillars of RDoC.”The RDoC project is a translational research effort to encourage new ways of studying psychopathology through a focus on disruptions in normal functions (such as reward learning or attention) that are defined jointly by observable behavior and neurobiological measures. The paper outlined the principles of the RDoC research framework, including emphases on research that acquires data from multiple measurement classes to foster integrative analyses, adopts dimensional approaches, and employs novel methods for ascertaining participants and identifying valid subgroups. Discussion: To mark the first decade of the RDoC initiative, we revisit the seven pillars and highlight new research findings and updates to the framework that are related to each. This reappraisal emphasizes the flexible nature of the RDoC framework and its application in diverse areas of research, new findings related to the importance of developmental trajectories within and across neurobehavioral domains, and the value of computational approaches for clarifying complex multivariate relations among behavioral and neurobiological systems. Conclusion: The seven pillars of RDoC have provided a foundation that has helped to guide a surge of new studies that have examined neurobehavioral domains related to mental disorders, in the service of informing future psychiatric nosology. Building on this footing, future areas of emphasis for the RDoC project will include studying centralperipheral interactions, developing novel approaches to phenotyping for genomic studies, and identifying new targets for clinical trial research to facilitate progress in precision psychiatry.},

  abstract = {Using diagnostic testing to determine the presence or absence of a disease is essential in clinical practice. In many cases, test results are obtained as continuous values and require a process of conversion and interpretation and into a dichotomous form to determine the presence of a disease. The primary method used for this process is the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve is used to assess the overall diagnostic performance of a test and to compare the performance of two or more diagnostic tests. It is also used to select an optimal cut-off value for determining the presence or absence of a disease. Although clinicians who do not have expertise in statistics do not need to understand both the complex mathematical equation and the analytic process of ROC curves, understanding the core concepts of the ROC curve analysis is a prerequisite for the proper use and interpretation of the ROC curve. This review describes the basic concepts for the correct use and interpretation of the ROC curve, including parametric/nonparametric ROC curves, the meaning of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), the partial AUC, methods for selecting the best cut-off value, and the statistical software to use for ROC curve analyses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is the compendium of disorder listings and diagnostic criteria used by clinicians in the United States and many other countries. The forthcoming fifth edition of the manual (DSM-5) represents an opportunity to not only update diagnostic information in concert with recent advances in the science and practice of psychiatry, but also to more strongly consider the integration of systematically gathered patient self-assessments of symptom severity. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To present information on planned changes to the DSM diagnostic assessment strategies that incorporate patient-reported data. METHODS: Activities of the DSM-5 work groups and study groups related to patient-reported assessments are summarized. These activities include critical reviews of past research, reviews of assessment instruments, development of assessment strategies incorporating dimensional assessments of patients' clinical symptoms, and testing of proposed strategies. RESULTS: Limitations of the current DSM diagnostic assessment system are discussed. With the current approach to diagnosis used in DSM-IV, clinicians must decide whether a patient meets the diagnostic criteria set forth for a disorder and then diagnose the disorder as present or absent. This categorical approach to the diagnostic threshold constricts the range of clinical information that may be of high importance to treatment planning, prognosis, and monitoring treatment outcomes. Advantages to incorporation of a dimensional assessment strategy are also discussed. A dimensional approach to psychiatric diagnosis provides clinicians with more information, and with standardized dimensional rating scales, can give patient self-reports a greater role in the clinical process. A description of the proposed methods for integrating dimensional assessments into DSM-5 is presented. Initial pilot testing of these changes to DSM indicate that clinicians and patients/patient informants found the dimensional measures to be useful, simple, and relevant to clinical care. DISCUSSION: The introduction of patient-reported symptom assessments as part of the DSM would represent a major change in psychiatric practice, with implications for patient care, mental health policy, and health care funding. The ultimate goal of such a change is to increase patient satisfaction with care and improve treatment outcomes. These goals will be the subject of continuing evaluation after the DSM-5 is published. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVISION AND USE: The use of patient-reported dimensional assessments of symptom severity will aid in more comprehensive and systematized characterizations of baseline clinical status and subsequent changes in clinical status with treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES: The use of principles of evidence-based medicine and measurement-based care are likely to increase in the United States as health care reform measures are put into place. The DSM-5 proposals for patient-reported measures can serve as an initial method for gauging the outcomes of treatments. IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: As with previous editions of the DSM, the changes implemented in DSM-5 will continue to be the focus of research efforts after publication. Results from this research will serve as the basis for further refinements in measurement recommendations.},

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75\% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.},

METHOD: Eleven academic centers in the United States and Canada were selected,and each was assigned several target diagnoses frequently treated in that setting.Consecutive patients visiting a site during the study were screened and stratified on the basis of DSM-IV diagnoses or symptomatic presentations. Patients were randomly assigned to two clinicians for a diagnostic interview; clinicians were blind to any previous diagnosis. All data were entered directly via an Internet-based software system to a secure central server. Detailed research design and statistical methods are presented in an accompanying article. RESULTS: There were a total of 15 adult and eight child/adolescent diagnoses for which adequate sample sizes were obtained to report adequately precise estimates of the intraclass kappa. Overall, five diagnoses were in the very good range(kappa=0.60–0.79), nine in the good range(kappa=0.40–0.59), six in the questionable range (kappa = 0.20–0.39), and three in the unacceptable range (kappa values,0.20). Eight diagnoses had insufficient sample sizes to generate precise kappa estimates at any site. CONCLUSIONS: Most diagnoses adequately tested had good to very good reliability with these representative clinical populations assessed with usual clinical interview methods. Some diagnoses that were revised to encompass a broader spectrum of symptom expression or had a more dimensional approach tested in the good to very good range.},

However, because HiTOP is based on analyses of standardized symptom criteria and close-ended survey items, it may just reflect the structure of available measures.  This study provides a novel test of HiTOP’s generalizability by comparing it to the structure of psychopathology derived from the natural language people use when talking about their mental health.  For our analysis, we obtained 87,007 naturalistic descriptions of mental health from \&gt;55,625 unique users on 27 online Reddit forums (i.e., subreddits).  We used text embeddings in large language models to represent common themes of posts in the subreddits, each dedicated to a different diagnosis or maladaptive trait.  Semantic similarity of posts across subreddits was quantified with a cosine similarity matrix. We then fit exploratory factor models to this matrix and examined the hierarchical structure with a bass-akwards approach. Results showed the natural language structure of psychopathology closely corresponds to the HiTOP model, with factors resembling internalizing, detachment, thought disorder, substance use, antagonism, and somatoform spectra at the lowest level of the hierarchy.  The higher-order factors diverged from HiTOP, including a general factor of problem construal reflecting variation in attribution of problems to internal vs. external sources.  Overall, the emergence of HiTOP spectra from natural language offers unique evidence for its validity and clinical utility.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the coherence of a set of statements is a long standing problem with many potential applications that has attracted researchers from different sciences. The special case of measuring coherence of topics has been recently studied to remedy the problem that topic models give no guaranty on the interpretablity of their output. Several benchmark datasets were produced that record human judgements of the interpretability of topics. We are the first to propose a framework that allows to construct existing word based coherence measures as well as new ones by combining elementary components. We conduct a systematic search of the space of coherence measures using all publicly available topic relevance data for the evaluation. Our results show that new combinations of components outperform existing measures with respect to correlation to human ratings. Finally, we outline how our results can be transferred to further applications in the context of text mining, information retrieval and the world wide web.},

  abstract = {Describing and understanding personality structure is fundamental to predict and explain human behavior. Recent research calls for large personality item pools to be analyzed from the bottom-up, as item-level analysis may reveal meaningful differences often obscured by aggregation. This study introduces and applies Taxonomic Graph Analysis (TGA), a comprehensive network psychometrics framework aimed at identifying hierarchical structures from the bottom-up, to an open-source 300-item IPIP-NEO dataset (N = 149,337). This framework addresses key methodological challenges that have hindered accurate recovery of hierarchical structures, including local independence violations, wording effects, dimensionality assessment, and structural robustness. TGA revealed a three-level structure composed of 28 first-level dimensions (facets), 6 second-level dimensions (traits), and 3 third-level dimensions (meta-traits). Although some dimensions aligned with the theoretical IPIP-NEO structure, there were considerable deviations including the emergence of Sociability, Integrity, and Impulsivity traits at the second-level and a novel Disinhibition meta-trait at the third-level. The overarching theme of our findings was a hierarchical structure that integrated empirical and theoretical findings that have been scattered across the personality literature, demonstrating TGA’s value to investigate hierarchical psychological constructs. This study contributes to discussions on personality taxonomy by providing a rigorous, data-driven perspective on the IPIP-NEO’s hierarchical structure.},

EWSs could thus reflect personalized warning signals for impending psychopathology. We empirically investigated this hypothesis in at-risk youths (N = 122, mean age = 23.6 ± 0.7 years, 57\% males) from the clinical cohort of Tracking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS-CC), who provided daily emotion assessments for 6 months. We analyzed whether EWSs (rising autocorrelations and standard deviations in emotions) preceded transitions toward psychopathology. Across indicators and a range of analytical options, EWSs had low sensitivity (M = 26\%, SD = 11\%) and moderate specificity (M = 75\%, SD = 14\%). Thus, in the present sample, the proposed generic nature and clinical utility of EWSs could not be substantiated. Given this finding, we call for a more nuanced view on the application of complex-dynamic-systems principles to psychopathology and lay out key questions to be addressed in the future.},

This paper proposes integrating both publicly available organic data from social media and newspapers with more traditional indicators of forced migration to determine when and where people will move. We combine movement and organic variables with spatial and temporal variation within different Bayesian models and show the viability of our method using a case study involving displacement in Iraq. Our analysis shows that incorporating open-source generated conversation and event variables maintains or improves predictive accuracy over traditional variables alone. This work is an important step toward understanding how to leverage organic big data for societal–scale problems.},

  abstract = {International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding plays a significant role in classifying morbidity and mortality rates. Currently, ICD codes are assigned to a patient’s medical record by hand by medical practitioners or specialist clinical coders. This practice is prone to errors, and training skilled clinical coders requires time and human resources. Automatic prediction of ICD codes can help alleviate this burden. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based architecture with label-wise attention for predicting ICD codes on a medical dataset. The transformer model is first pre-trained from scratch on a medical dataset. Once this is done, the pre-trained model is used to generate representations of the tokens in the clinical documents, which are fed into the label-wise attention layer. Finally, the outputs from the label-wise attention layer are fed into a feed-forward neural network to predict appropriate ICD codes for the input document. We evaluate our model using hospital discharge summaries and their corresponding ICD-9 codes from the MIMIC-III dataset. Our experimental results show that our transformer model outperforms all previous models in terms of micro-F1 for the full label set from the MIMIC-III dataset. This is also the first successful application of a pre-trained transformer architecture to the auto-coding problem on the full MIMIC-III dataset.},

The slow progress is partly due to the poor sensitivity, specificity and replicability of many findings in the literature, which have in turn been attributed to small effect sizes, small sample sizes and inadequate statistical power. A commonly proposed solution is to focus on large, consortia-sized samples. Yet it is abundantly clear that increasing sample sizes will have a limited impact unless a more fundamental issue is addressed: the precision with which target behavioral phenotypes are measured. Here, we discuss challenges, outline several ways forward and provide worked examples to demonstrate key problems and potential solutions. A precision phenotyping approach can enhance the discovery and replicability of associations between biology and psychopathology.},

Numerous methods of topic modeling have been developed which consider many kinds of relationships and restrictions within datasets; however, these methods are not frequently employed. Instead many researchers gravitate to Latent Dirichlet Analysis, which although flexible and adaptive, is not always suited for modeling more complex data relationships. We present different topic modeling approaches capable of dealing with correlation between topics, the changes of topics over time, as well as the ability to handle short texts such as encountered in social media or sparse text data. We also briefly review the algorithms which are used to optimize and infer parameters in topic modeling, which is essential to producing meaningful results regardless of method. We believe this review will encourage more diversity when performing topic modeling and help determine what topic modeling method best suits the user needs.},

However, for short texts they generally suffer from data sparsity because of extremely limited word co-occurrences; thus tend to yield repetitive or trivial topics with low quality. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a novel neural topic model in the framework of autoencoding with a new topic distribution quantization approach generating peakier distributions that are more appropriate for modeling short texts. Besides the encoding, to tackle this issue in terms of decoding, we further propose a novel negative sampling decoder learning from negative samples to avoid yielding repetitive topics. We observe that our model can highly improve short text topic modeling performance. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate our model can outperform both strong traditional and neural baselines under extreme data sparsity scenes, producing high-quality topics.},
